Hello Github world!
Thanks to the github community and to everyone who reads this profile. Thanks to the whole world, really.
I am interested in everything, curious like a cat
- I am currently learning how to manage with Ubuntu, beginning with Python- "Romanus eunt domus"!-, and ocassionally, when the chance comes
working in architecture mostly in construction and project management.
- I'm looking to collaborate on anything that can be learned, I could help translating from english to spanish, which is my first language, so if anybody needs a translation just asks because translating is always a good exercise to improve my english and also I learn about what I am translating. I am not a professional but I assure you my translation in spanish will be properly written.
I don't think I am ready to start my own github project right now, I need to learn the basics.

I wrote the text above a while ago... I am learning by myself so I don't have an estructured metholodogy so I jump from one thing to another, making all the possible mistakes, rolling back continuosly and probably doing a lot of weird things because I don't really know what I am doing, I just try...
If any time happens that someone by chance comes to one of my repositories I advise you about what you can find:
- I use the standards when I learn about them, so probably there are many missing or just wrong.
- The structure of the repository surely is a mess, don't try to understand it. I don't understand it myself.
- Probably most of the things don't work.
- If I use someone else's repository and I don't follow the rules or do something I am not supposed to, sorry in advance, but surely it was not my intention, just lack of knowledge.
