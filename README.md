- 👋 Hi, I’m @TomasQA
I’m interested in everything, curious like a cat
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to manage with Ubuntu, beginning with Python, and ocassionally, when the chance comes
working in architecture mostly in construction and project management.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can be learned, I could help translating from english to spanish, which is my first language
I don't think I am ready to start my own github project right now, I need to learn the basics.

Thanks to the github community and to everyone who reads this profile. Thanks to the whole world, really.
